I've worked at MOD on and off for about two years now, and after years of trying different combinations of toppings, here's the collection of toppings that I believe make up the best MOD pizza.

Sauce: Barbeque

Before the cheese: Garlic rub, light basil

Cheese: Light mozzarella

Meats: Pepperoni, bacon
Optional for extra flavor: Spicy sausage, salami

Vegtables: Crumpled and light red onions, light corn

To top it off: Light arugula, light cheddar cheese, oregano

Make sure you request extra crispy!

After it's done: Light buffalo sauce

Perfection.
