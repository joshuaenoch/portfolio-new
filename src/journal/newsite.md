When I came around to adding my newest projects to my portfolio website, I took one look at my old site and realized it was time for some change — design-wise, implementation-wise, and basically just everything-wise.
I've gotten inspiration from some clothing brand websites for this new design. A lot of them are simple yet aesthetically pleasing, and I've tried to capture that essence in some way. Projects are also way easier for me to add now. I had an interesting OOP approach before, which makes sense given my OOP background, but now everything goes straight from a JSON to the page.

As you can see, I've also decided to add this journal page. I hope to update this page once in a while and just chat about random things. Feel free to connect with me with one of my "socials" down below and suggest any improvements or ideas for this site.

Stay tuned for more –
